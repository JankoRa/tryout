Git is a free and open source, distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and
 efficiency. Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network
 access or a central server. Branching and merging are fast and easy to do. Git is used for version control of files, much like tools such as
 Mercurial, Subversion, CVS, Perforce, etc.
